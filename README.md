==========

This is very simple alfred workflow that will launch RSA SecurID, enter a pin (if provided), copy the current key to the clipboard, and then close the application.

Check out `Get-RSA-Key.alfredworkflow` for the ready to import version and `src` to see all the components of the workflow.

### Usage

__rsa__: Open RSA SecurID, copy the current key.

__rsa 12345__: Open RSA SecurID, enter the pin code 12345, copy the current key.
